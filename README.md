I'm a recent college graduate with a wide range of internship experience in the tech industry. 

After graduating with a degree in Economics, I completed an internship at the networking company Infoblox where I worked extensively in Excel with big data to compete some really fascinating pricing projects. This experience spurred my interest in data analytics and for the last few months, I've been pursuing a Data Science certification in Python. 

Technical Experience: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sci Kit, StatsModels), Excel (Pivot Tables, Database Theory, Lookups, Solver, Large Scale Data), SQL
